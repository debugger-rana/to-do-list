## 🎯 Tips & Best Practices

### Speaking Tips
- **Speak Clearly**: Use normal speaking pace
- **Wait for Prompt**: Start speaking after seeing "Listening..."
- **Use Exact Phrases**: Stick to the command formats
- **Keep it Simple**: Shorter commands work better

### Task Numbering
- **Start from 1**: First task is "task 1", not "task 0"
- **Visual Reference**: Look at the list to see current task numbers
- **After Deletion**: Numbers automatically update

### Command Formats
✅ **Correct**:
- "Add task buy milk"
- "Delete task 2" 
- "Change task 1 to new text"

❌ **Incorrect**:
- "Create a task about buying milk"
- "Remove the second task"
- "Modify task 1"

### Efficiency Tips
- **Keyboard Shortcut**: Use Ctrl+Space for quick access
- **Batch Operations**: Add multiple tasks in sequence
- **Voice Editing**: Use "Change task X to..." for quick updates
- **Manual Backup**: Use regular buttons if voice fails

### Privacy Notes
- **Local Processing**: Voice recognition happens in your browser
- **No Server**: Your voice data isn't sent to external servers
- **Browser Only**: Only your browser hears your commands
